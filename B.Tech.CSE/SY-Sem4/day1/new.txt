Road accidents have been and will continue to be one of     greatest health hazards. Statistically, it has been shown that     number of death and injuries due to road accidents has been steadily increased within     past five years.There are many causes of road accidents but, personally, I think     most important factor which contributes to road accidents is     irresponsibility of     drivers. Driving    automobile is   privilege, which many people succeed to abuse.
