# 4Years_of_Coding_2013-2017

## Myself ##
Hi, I am Shriraj (aka sr13). I am a computer science enthusiast and programming is just another one of my hobbies.

## RepoInfo ##
This repository will represent all the coding* I have done in my institutions. The timespan is of 4 years ranging from coding in my high school days to my current undergrad life.
The languages I used are C and C++ (maybe a bit of C++11.. here and there.. ;P)
I have made this repo to remember those years when I just started to code and feel the importance of those teeny tiny basics, which helped me to reach the programming level I have.

*Note: This repo contains the code that I have done as a part of the curriculum. Ofcourse it does include my own touch and some extra inputs which I love, but in no way it represents all of the code I worked on in those days. I collected all the major tidbits and made this repo to represent those good old coding days. :)
